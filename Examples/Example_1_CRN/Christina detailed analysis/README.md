# Code related to the testing of SODAs for CRNs

*Note: Due to file reorginization for publishing, filepaths referenced in the code may need be to be altered*

## Folder structure:



1. **discovery_svd**: code for performing model discovery for each of CRNs 1-3 and subsequent SVD analysis

2. **figs**: .svg files organized in folders by figure in manuscript/type

3. **processed_results**: .csv files resulting from noise/library size robustness trials, labelled by CRN #

4. **testing**: preliminary code to produce data for noise/library size robustness figures

5. **def_all_crns.py**: definitions of ODEs describing CRNs 1-3

6. **remaining files**: producing data for manuscript figures, plotting manuscript figures
